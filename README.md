### Description <a name="introduction"></a>
Vigenère Cipher, created by French cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère is a method of encrypting plaintext using a simple polyaplabetic solution.
A repeating keyword or passphrase determines the amount by which each letter in the plaintext is moved. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced with the matching letter in the repeating keyword, and the keyword is repeated until it is the same length as the plaintext.
